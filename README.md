# slow-loris-challenge
Imagine you own a baby Slow Loris (engl. for Plumplori). It’s tiny and because you care about its health, you weigh your new friend regularly. (Please do never pet a real Slow Loris!) Unfortunately you are a poor student and you only have an old balance with two plates suitable for placing objects to be weighed. You own different calibrated masses which can be placed on the plate to weigh the tiny loris. After you’ve weighed it, you get a smart idea for a program. So you implement an algorithm which receives the weight of the slow loris and returns the masses that need to be placed on the plates.
